                The <code>&lt;sbpro-dashboard-head&gt;</code> element template by default uses the <code>.pb-10</code> spacing utility classes to add paddig to the bottom.
                Then, the first container within the main element uses the <code>.mt-n10</code> spacing utility to give the container an equivilant,
                negative top margin to create the overlap effect.

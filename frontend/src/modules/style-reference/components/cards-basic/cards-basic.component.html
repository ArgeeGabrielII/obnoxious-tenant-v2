                The example above is a basic card with a card header and a card body. You can extend the card using any of the features included with Bootstrap.

                <span class="font-weight-bold">Note:</span> The card styling in SB Admin Pro looks best with a light background color due to the background color of the card header, card body, and box shadow.

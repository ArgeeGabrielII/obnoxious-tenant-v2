                You can pass in <code>TemplateRef</code> instead of a <code>string</code>

ng-template(#itemTemplate1)
    .card.shadow-sm
        .card-body
            h5.text-primary Beginning
            p.
                This is the content for the first timeline item. 
                In this styled example, we're styling the timeline marker with background 
                and typography utility classes. 
                We've also shown that you can use the card component within the timeline item content.

ng-template(#itemTemplate2)
    .card.shadow-sm
        .card-body
            h5.text-success Second Item
            p.
                This is the content for the second timeline item. 
                In this timeline example, we're also using some spacing utilities on the timeline 
                item content to remove the padding from the top of that element.                
ng-template(#itemTemplate3)
    .card.shadow-sm
        .card-body
            h5.text-secondary Third Item
            p.
                This is the content for the third timeline item. 
                Keep in mind this is just an example of what you can put within the 
                timeline item content. 
                There are many other ways you can use this timeline, and it's fully responsive too!
ng-template(#itemTemplate4)
    .card.shadow-sm
        .card-body
            h5.text-warning Last Item
            p.
                You can use different icons in the icon markers, letters, 
                or no icons at all if you just want a blank circle.

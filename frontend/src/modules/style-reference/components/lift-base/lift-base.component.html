            <div class="sbp-preview-text">The lift utility can be used by adding the <code>.lift</code> class to any element. In the above example, it is being used along with a Bootstrap card and a Bootstrap button. Since the lift utility is a hover effect, it should mostly be used with links! When a lifted item is clicked, an active styling will be applied bringing the element back to its base position.</div>
